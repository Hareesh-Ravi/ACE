# ACE - Anti-forensic Contrast Enhancement
This repository has the code to the process of anti-forensically enhancing the contrast of an image as described in the paper "ACE - An Effective Anti-forensic Contrast Enhancement Technique" ( [PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7359180) ). If you use this code, please cite the following paper as,

## Usage
```
normal_enhanced, antiforensic_enhanced = perform_CE(input_image, gamma) 
```

The input is an image that you want to enhance and output is the
anti forensically contrast enhanced image. The main function uses ```Anti_TV.m``` that performs the 
actual TV norm based optimization as described in the paper
